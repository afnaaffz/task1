<p>Providence Womenâ€™s College, Calicut, is one of the largest higher education centers for women in the state of Kerala. It was established in 1952 by the Sisters of Apostolic Carmel, as a noble initiative to spread the message of empowerment through education among the women folk in the Malabar region.

Providence College is the result of the collective effort of a committed group headed by our founder Principal, Mother Gabrielle</p>
